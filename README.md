Regression is the statistical method to 
assess the relationship between two or more 
variables.  Regression is used to predict 
values of an outcome variables from one or 
more predictor variables. For example, 
using regression one can predict salary 
using education and study domain of a 
student. The problem of regression is that 
the predicted result may contain some error. 
Regression is complicated process of 
calculation and analysis. One of major 
problem is  when there is outliers in the 
dataset. Outliers are the dataset that are 
distant from the rest of the dataset. Other 
problem is regression cannot be used in 
case of qualitative phenomenon like 
honesty, happiness and so on.
